This is an example of how to use the 433MHz wireless transmitter module
(HCMODU0007) which is the Tx part of the tranmitter and receiver module pair.
This example makes use of the VirtualWire library written by Mike McCauley.
The sketch will read a value from the analogue input A0 and transmit it as
2 bytes to the receiver module once every second.

Tx MODULE CONNECTIONS:

PIN  DESCRIPTION      ARDUINO PIN
1    GND              GND
2    VCC (3.5-12V)    VCC
3    TX DATA          D2
